# Cars Form
A page that allows users to add, search for, and delete car listings with a name and price. Made with React and Redux.

## How to Use
* Running the Program: `npm run start`
  
## Stack
* React
  * Using state to change elements on the page (like the price total) in real time as new cars are added to the list
  * Including a search input that changes the returned results as it is being typed by the user
* Redux
  * Using Redux to track the state of the car entries and the form on the page

## Upcoming Features
- [ ] Have the page maintain the entered car list after page refresh
- [ ] \(Optional) Include an image with each car name (maybe give user the ability to upload their own image)
